# Overview of Word library (DocIO)

Essential DocIO is a native [.NET Word library](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word-framework/net) that is used by developers to create, read, write, and convert Microsoft Word documents by using C#, VB.NET, and managed C++ code from any of the following .NET platforms - [Windows Forms](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-windows-forms), [WPF](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-wpf), [ASP.NET](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-asp-net), [ASP.NET MVC](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-asp-net-mvc), [ASP.NET Core](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-asp-net-core), [Blazor](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-blazor), [WPF](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-wpf), [Xamarin](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-xamarin), [WinUI](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-winui) and [.NET MAUI applications](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/docio/create-word-document-in-maui). 

It is a non-UI component that provides a full-fledged document instance model similar to the Microsoft Office COM libraries to iterate with the document elements explicitly and perform necessary manipulation. It is built from scratch in C# and does not require Microsoft Word to be installed in the machine. It supports Word 97-2003 and later version documents.
