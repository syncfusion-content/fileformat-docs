# Overview of Word library (DocIO)

Essential DocIO is a native [.NET Word library](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word-framework/net) that is used by developers to create, read, write, and convert Microsoft Word documents by using C#, VB.NET, and managed C++ code from any of the following .NET platforms - Windows Forms, WPF, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Windows Store applications, and Xamarin applications. 

It is a non-UI component that provides a full-fledged document instance model similar to the Microsoft Office COM libraries to iterate with the document elements explicitly and perform necessary manipulation. It is built from scratch in C# and does not require Microsoft Word to be installed in the machine. It supports Word 97-2003 and later version documents.
