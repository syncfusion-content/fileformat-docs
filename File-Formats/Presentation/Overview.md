# Overview of PowerPoint Presentation

The PowerPoint framework is a feature rich [.NET PowerPoint class library](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net) that can be used by developers to create, read, and write Microsoft PowerPoint files by using C#, VB.NET, and managed C++ code. The library can be used in [Windows Forms](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net), [WPF](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net), [ASP.NET Web Forms](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net), [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net), [ASP.NET Core](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net-core), [Blazor](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/blazor), [UWP](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/uwp), [Xamarin](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/xamarin) applications.

It is a non-UI component that provides a full-fledged PowerPoint presentation instance that facilitates accessing and manipulating the presentations without any dependency of Microsoft Office COM libraries and Microsoft Office.
