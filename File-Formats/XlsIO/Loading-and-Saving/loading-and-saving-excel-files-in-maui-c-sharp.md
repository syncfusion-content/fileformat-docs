You can open an existing workbook from stream by using the overloads of [Open](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/file-formats/Syncfusion.XlsIO.IWorkbooks.html#Syncfusion_XlsIO_IWorkbooks_Open_System_IO_Stream_) methods of [IWorkbooks](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/file-formats/Syncfusion.XlsIO.IWorkbooks.html) interface.

//Creates a new instance for ExcelEngine
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

//Initialize IApplication
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Load the file into stream
Assembly executingAssembly = typeof(App).GetTypeInfo().Assembly;
Stream inputStream = executingAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream("MAUISample.Sample.xlsx");

//Loads or open an existing workbook through Open method of IWorkbooks
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);
