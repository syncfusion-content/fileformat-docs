  IWorkbook destinationWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("DestinationWorkbook.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

  //The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection in the Source Workbook is accessed.
  IWorksheet sourceWorksheet = sourceWorkbook.Worksheets[0];

  //The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection in the Destination Workbook is accessed.
  IWorksheet destinationWorksheet = destinationWorkbook.Worksheets[0];

  //Assigning an object to the range of cells (90 rows) both for source and destination.
