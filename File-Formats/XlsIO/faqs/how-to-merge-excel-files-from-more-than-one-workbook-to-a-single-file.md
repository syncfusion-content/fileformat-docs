# How to merge Excel files from more than one workbook to a single file?

You can merge several Excel files from more than one workbook to a single file. The following code snippet illustrates this.

{% tabs %}  
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}
//Loads all the template documents from Data folder
string[] files = Directory.GetFiles("../../Data/");

using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
  application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013;

  //Create empty Excel workbook instance with one empty worksheet
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(1);

  //Enumerates all the workbook files from the data folder and clone and merge it into new workbook
  foreach (string file in files)
  {
    //Loads the all template document from data folder
	FileStream inputStream = new FileStream(file, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

	//Opens the template workbook from stream
	IWorkbook tempWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);

	//Disposes the stream
	inputStream.Dispose();

	//Cloning all workbook's worksheets
	workbook.Worksheets.AddCopy(tempWorkbook.Worksheets);
  }

  //Removing the first empty worksheet
  workbook.Worksheets.Remove(0);

  workbook.SaveAs("MergingFiles.xlsx");
}
{% endhighlight %}
