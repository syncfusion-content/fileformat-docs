# How to open an Excel file from stream?

XlsIO provides support for opening a file that is stored as a stream. The following code snippet illustrates this.

{% tabs %}  
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
  application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013;

  //Opening a File from a Stream
  FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite);
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileStream);
  workbook.SaveAs("Output.xlsx");
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb.net tabtitle="VB.NET" %}
Using excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()
  Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
  application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013

  'Opening a File from a Stream
  Dim fileStream As New FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite)
  Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileStream)
  workbook.SaveAs("Output.xlsx")
End Using
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="UWP" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

  //Opening a File from a Stream
  Stream inputStream = new FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
  IWorkbook workbook = await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(inputStream, ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

  //Initializes FileSavePicker
  FileSavePicker savePicker = new FileSavePicker();
  savePicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.Desktop;
  savePicker.SuggestedFileName = "Output";
  savePicker.FileTypeChoices.Add("Excel Files", new List<string>() { ".xlsx" });

  //Creates a storage file from FileSavePicker
  StorageFile storageFile = await savePicker.PickSaveFileAsync();

  //Saves changes to the specified storage file
  await workbook.SaveAsAsync(storageFile);
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="ASP.NET Core" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

  //Opening a File from a Stream
  FileStream inputStream = new FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream, ExcelOpenType.Automatic);
  FileStream stream = new FileStream("Output.xlsx", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
  workbook.SaveAs(stream);
  workbook.Close();
  excelEngine.Dispose();
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="Xamarin" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

  //Opening a File from a Stream
  Assembly assembly = typeof(App).GetTypeInfo().Assembly;
  Stream fileStream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("App.Sample.xlsx");
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileStream);

  MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
  workbook.SaveAs(stream);
  stream.Position = 0;
  //Save the stream as a file in the device and invoke it for viewing
  Xamarin.Forms.DependencyService.Get<ISave>().SaveAndView("Output.xlsx", "application/msexcel", stream);
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
