# How to overcome UnauthorizedAccessException?

The [UnauthorizedAccessException](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.unauthorizedaccessexception?view=netcore-3.1) occurs when you are trying to write in a read-only/hidden file or if you donâ€™t have access to the particular folder that contains the file or the folder might be locked currently. 

First, check whether you can access the folder and the file directly. Then, right-click the input file and check whether the Read-only/Hidden checkbox is checked. If it is checked, kindly uncheck the Read-only/Hidden checkbox and try running the project as an administrator or an authorized user to access the file folder.
