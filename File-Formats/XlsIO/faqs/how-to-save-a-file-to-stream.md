# How to save a file to stream?

XlsIO provides support to save a workbook to a .NET stream. The following code snippet illustrates this.

{% tabs %}  

{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
  application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013;
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

  //Save the workbook to stream
  FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("Output.xlsx", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.ReadWrite);
  workbook.SaveAs(fileStream);
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb.net tabtitle="VB.NET" %}
Using excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()
  Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
  application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2013
  Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)

  'Save the workbook to stream
  Dim fileStream As New FileStream("Output.xlsx", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.ReadWrite)
  workbook.SaveAs(fileStream)
End Using
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="UWP" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
  Stream inputStream = new FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
  IWorkbook workbook = await application.Workbooks.OpenAsync(inputStream, ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

  //Save the workbook to stream
  FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("Output.xlsx", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
  await workbook.SaveAsAsync(fileStream);
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="ASP.NET Core" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
  FileStream inputStream = new FileStream("Sample.xlsx", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream, ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

  //Save the workbook to stream
  FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("Output.xlsx", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
  workbook.SaveAs(fileStream);
  workbook.Close();
  excelEngine.Dispose();
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# tabtitle="Xamarin" %}
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
  IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
  Assembly assembly = typeof(App).GetTypeInfo().Assembly;
  Stream inputStream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("App.Sample.xlsx");
  IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);

  //Save the workbook to stream
  MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
  workbook.SaveAs(stream);
  stream.Position = 0;

  //Save the stream as a file in the device and invoke it for viewing
  Xamarin.Forms.DependencyService.Get<ISave>().SaveAndView("Output.xlsx", "application/msexcel", stream);
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
