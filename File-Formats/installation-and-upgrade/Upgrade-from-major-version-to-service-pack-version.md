# Upgrade from major version to service pack version

Syncfusion provides a new Volume release once in every three months which has exciting new features. For that Volume release, there may be one or two Service Pack releases. The issues in the Volume release will be addressed in the Service Pack releases. You can download and install the latest Service Pack installer [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/latest-version). 


It is not required to install the Volume release before installing the Service Pack release. As Volume and Service Packs releases works independently, you can directly install the latest Service Pack contains major issue fixes.
