# Welcome to Syncfusion Essential File Formats Platform

Essential File Formats is a collection of .NET class libraries to create, edit, write, and convert PDF, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint file formats in .NET Framework [C#, VB.NET], .NET Core, UWP, and Xamarin applications without Microsoft Office or Adobe dependencies.

## How to best read this user guide

* The best way to get started would be to read the “Getting Started” section for the component you would like to start first. The “Getting Started” and “Assemblies required” sections gives enough information, so it is recommended to read these sections end-to-end before starting to write a code. All other information can be referred as needed. 
* After learning the basics about the component, integrate the component into your application. A good starting point is to refer to the code examples in the sample browser and in this user guide. It is very likely that you can find a code example that resembles your intended usage scenario. 
* Another valuable resource is available in the [API reference](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/file-formats) that provides detailed information on the object hierarchy as well as the settings available on every object.

## Additional help resources

The [Knowledge Base](http://www.syncfusion.com/kb/) section contains responses for common questions asked by the customers. This would be a good place to search for the topics that are not covered in the User Guide.

Similar to the Knowledge Base, the [Forum](http://www.syncfusion.com/forums/) section also contains responses to the questions that are asked by other customers.

## File Format Security Information

Syncfusion products are used   in some of the most sensitive applications.  We must be concerned about security.

We prioritized security when developing our products.  Each control is self-contained and does not require outside server or Syncfusion API.  Our products  exist as defined by the developer and only do the commands defined by the developer.  We built them to work with any security paradigms that our customers can utilize.

Our customers cannot use any hosted Web APIs provided by syncfusion.  We provide the necessary libraries and code examples for our customers to build their own APIs by allowing them to customize the functionality  and manage their own security.
